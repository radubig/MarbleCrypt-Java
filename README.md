# MarbleCrypt-Java

This project is a port of [MarbleCrypt](https://github.com/radubig/MarbleCrypt) (v1.0.1) to Java, with soon-to-be-added features like database for persistence and audit services.

This project uses [JSFML](https://jsfml.sfmlprojects.org/), a SFML binding for Java which is no longer maintained, but necessary for easier porting of the graphics code from the original project.
